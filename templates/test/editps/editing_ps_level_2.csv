editing_ps_level_2,You need to composite two images with very different lighting so that the subject from Image A looks natural in Image B’s environment. Which workflow is most appropriate?,,Match Colour adjustment on Image A layer → Blend Mode: Soft Light → Gaussian Blur on mask,,Apply Curves adjustment with a Luminosity blend mode on Image A layer → Create Global Light in Shadows/Highlights → Use Camera Raw Filter for final colour grading,,Use Colour Replacement Tool on Image A → Change Blend Mode to Colour → Apply High Pass filter,,Rasterize Image A → Use Dodge and Burn tools to match highlights and shadows,,b,mcq,
editing_ps_level_2,"When preparing an image for high end retouching (frequency separation), which of the following describes the two layers you create?",,"Low Frequency Layer: Gaussian Blur to capture colour/tone; High Frequency Layer: Apply Image subtracting blurred layer, set to Linear Light blending",,"Low Frequency Layer: Apply Median filter; High Frequency Layer: Use High Pass filter at 0.5px radius, set to Overlay",,Low Frequency Layer: Convert to Smart Object; High Frequency Layer: Apply Unsharp Mask,,Low Frequency Layer: Use Surface Blur; High Frequency Layer: Clone Stamp only on details,,a,mcq,
editing_ps_level_2,You want to create a non destructive vignette that adapts to any canvas size and can be edited later. What’s the best approach?,,Add a new layer → Use Elliptical Marquee → Inverse selection → Fill with black → Lower opacity,,"Create a Solid Colour fill layer → Add a Layer Mask → Use Gradient tool (Radial, black-to-white) on the mask → Group and convert to Smart Object",,Use Lens Correction filter → Manually adjust Vignette sliders → Apply as Smart Filter,,Duplicate Background → Convert to Smart Object → Apply Camera Raw Filter vignette,,b,mcq,

editing_ps_level_2,You need to create a displacement map to wrap a texture naturally over 3D-rendered text. Which steps are correct?,,Duplicate text layer → Rasterize it → Apply Gaussian Blur → Save as PSD → Use Displace filter on texture layer,,Render text to shape → Export paths as Illustrator file → Use that as displacement map,,"Create a grayscale rendering of the underlying surface (flattened, high-contrast) → Save as PSD → Apply Displace filter on texture layer using that PSD",,Use Displacement Map adjustment layer → Select text layer as source,,c,mcq,
editing_ps_level_2,Which technique gives you the ability to globally tweak every layer’s opacity and blending mode all at once?,,Select all layers → Press Shift + [,,Add all layers into a Layer Group → Adjust the group’s opacity and blend mode,,Use the 'Global Opacity' slider in the Properties panel,,Convert all layers into a single Smart Object → Adjust its opacity,,b,mcq,
editing_ps_level_2,"In a colour grading workflow, you want to isolate shadows, midtones, and highlights and apply different colour balances to each. Which feature lets you do this most precisely?",,Gradient Map,,Selective Colour,,Shadows/Midtones/Highlights adjustment,,Colour Lookup Tables (LUTs),,c,mcq,
editing_ps_level_2,"When using Data Driven Graphics (Variables) to generate multiple versions of an ad, how do you update text fields programmatically?",,Use the Type Tool to edit each text layer manually,,Import a CSV or XML file defining the variables → Bind Layers to Variables → Data Sets → Apply Data Sets,,Write a JavaScript in ExtendScript Toolkit targeting text layers,,Record an Action that types each variation and batch-play it,,b,mcq,
